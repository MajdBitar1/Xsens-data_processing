# Xsens-data-processing
 Using xsens dot 2 sensors, which output acceleration from an accelerometer, angular velocity from gyroscope along other stats. This code has functions that read, denoise and process the data (compute new parameters like velocity based on output parameters) as well as visualize it in many useful ways.
